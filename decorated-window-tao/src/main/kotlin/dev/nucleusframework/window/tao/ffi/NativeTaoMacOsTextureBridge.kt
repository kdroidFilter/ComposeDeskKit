/**
 * JNI bridge for external GPU texture import (TextureView) on macOS.
 * The native code lives in `texture.m`, compiled into
 * `libnucleus_tao_metal.dylib` — loading is delegated to [NativeMetalBridge]
 * (JNI method resolution searches every library loaded by the class loader,
 * so no second `load` is needed). Mirrors the Windows
 * [NativeTaoTextureBridge] / `nucleus_tao_gl.dll` arrangement.
 *
 * Import/destroy must run on the thread owning the Skia Metal `DirectContext`
 * (the host's render thread) so the texture is created on the same
 * `id<MTLDevice>` Skia renders with. Unlike Windows there is no per-frame
 * native call: Skia's own `makeImageSnapshot` performs the frame copy (see
 * `TextureViewMac.kt`). The test producer owns a private device + queue and is
 * safe from any single producer thread.
