/**
 * A satellite window: an auxiliary top-level that belongs to another window.
 *
 * Satellites are the floating tool palettes, inspectors and mixer strips of a
 * desktop app — windows that are *about* a document window rather than
 * documents of their own. The archetype comes from Flutter's multi-window
 * design; this is the Tao implementation of the same contract:
 *
 *  - **Anchored** — the initial position comes from a [WindowPositioner]
 *    ([SatelliteWindowState.positioner]) resolved against the parent's frame
 *    or a sub-rectangle of it, and kept inside the monitor work area.
 *  - **Follows its parent** — once placed, the satellite holds its offset from
 *    the parent's top-left corner: drag the parent and the satellite comes
 *    along. Drag the *satellite* and the new offset is what gets preserved.
 *  - **Above, but not modal** — it stays in front of its parent in z-order,
 *    keeps out of the taskbar / Dock / Alt-Tab, follows it across workspaces
 *    and minimisation, and leaves it fully interactive.
 *  - **Steps aside** — while the parent is fullscreen or maximized the
 *    satellite hides itself rather than covering content
 *    ([hideWhileParentFullscreenOrMaximized]). With that turned off it stays
 *    over its parent instead: the owner link is re-asserted across the
 *    transition, which is what keeps the platform from re-stacking the
 *    satellite behind the window it belongs to.
 *  - **Dies with its parent** — closing the parent closes the satellite;
 *    [onCloseRequest] fires so the caller can drop it from composition.
 *  - **Reparentable** — pass a different [parent] and the satellite moves to
 *    the new owner without changing its position on screen, which is how a
 *    single palette can serve whichever document window is active. This holds
 *    even when the previous owner closes in the same frame: the satellite steps
 *    out of its owner link before the old window is destroyed, so the OS never
 *    takes it down with it.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * DecoratedWindow(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication) {
 *     TitleBar { Text("Document") }
 *     Button({ palette = !palette }) { Text("Inspector") }
 *     if (palette) {
 *         SatelliteWindow(
 *             onCloseRequest = { palette = false },
 *             state = rememberSatelliteWindowState(
 *                 size = DpSize(260.dp, 420.dp),
 *                 positioner = WindowPositioner(
 *                     parentAnchor = WindowAnchor.TopRight,
 *                     childAnchor = WindowAnchor.TopLeft,
 *                     offset = DpOffset(12.dp, 0.dp),
 *                 ),
 *             ),
 *             title = "Inspector",
 *         ) {
 *             Inspector()
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Platform notes
 * Positioning a satellite requires the platform to let a client place its own
 * windows. Native **Wayland** does not (xdg-shell gives the compositor full
 * authority — GDK reports every toplevel at `(0, 0)` and ignores moves), so
 * there the satellite is a plain owned window: correct z-order, ownership,
 * lifetime and hide-while-maximized, but compositor-chosen placement, no
 * follow, and [SatelliteWindowState.offsetFromParent] stays `null` rather than
 * publishing a made-up offset. The window is still draggable, by the
 * compositor's own move. Run with `NUCLEUS_TAO_LINUX_RENDERER=x11`, or give
 * the window `forceX11`, when the anchoring matters. X11, XWayland, Windows
 * and macOS all follow.
 *
 * The work area the [WindowPositioner] keeps the satellite inside is the
 * parent's own monitor on Windows. macOS and Linux fall back to the primary
 * monitor's work area, so a parent on a secondary display whose Dock / panel
 * layout differs may see its satellite flipped or slid against the wrong edge.
 *
 * @param onCloseRequest invoked when the user closes the satellite, and when
 *   its parent is destroyed. Drop the satellite from composition here.
 * @param parent the window the satellite belongs to. Defaults to the enclosing
 *   [DecoratedWindow] via [LocalTaoWindow]; pass it explicitly to anchor to a
 *   window that isn't the one being composed. A `null` parent degrades to a
 *   plain top-level window.
 * @param hideWhileParentFullscreenOrMaximized hide the satellite while the
 *   parent fills the screen instead of floating over it. `true` matches the
 *   Flutter archetype.

 * it was given can be anchored to a parent rect that is about to change, or to
 * none at all. Re-read real geometry as soon as both windows are mapped; from
 * then on the offset the follow logic preserves is the anchored one.
 *
 * One successful re-anchor is not enough: a window manager can report a real
 * frame at the origin and apply the requested position several frames later
 * (openbox under Xvfb takes tens of milliseconds; a loaded desktop longer).
 * Anchoring to that frame latches an offset measured against a parent that was
 * never there, and the follow logic then preserves it forever — the satellite
 * trails its parent by exactly the distance the parent moved after the map. So
 * keep re-anchoring until the parent's frame has held still for
 * [PLACEMENT_SETTLE_STABLE_POLLS] polls, the only signal a WM gives that
 * placement is done.
 *
 * Keyed on the satellite, not on [anchoring]: a reparent swaps the anchoring
 * but must leave the satellite where it is on screen.
