/**
 * Lays [content] out with the satellites docked into this window around it.
 *
 * Panels attach to the four edges of the layout ([DockSide]). The sides nest
 * in [sideOrder], outermost first: the first side runs the full length of the
 * layout and owns its corners, the next one runs the length that is left, and
 * so on down to [content]. The default ([DefaultDockSideOrder] — top, bottom,
 * left, right) is the classic border layout; a reader that wants its navigation on the right at
 * full height and its commentary strip under the text *and* the left panel
 * says `listOf(Right, Bottom, Left, Top)`.
 *
 * The panels on one side share it in one of two ways:
 *
 *  - **Split** (the default): they divide the side's length in proportion to
 *    their [SatellitePlacement.Docked.weight], one above the other on a
 *    vertical side, side by side on a horizontal one, and share the side's
 *    thickness, [SatelliteWorkspace.dockExtent]. A splitter between the side
 *    and the content drags that thickness; a divider between two panels moves
 *    their weights.
 *  - **Layered** ([layeredSides]): each panel is a full-length layer of its
 *    own [SatellitePlacement.Docked.extent], laid from the edge towards the
 *    content — three panels docked on a layered right side are three columns
 *    next to each other, each with its own splitter and width. This is the
 *    arrangement of a nested split-pane tree, without the tree.
 *
 * With nothing docked — or while the workspace is not
 * [SatelliteWorkspace.visible] — the layout is just [content]. When the window
 * is too small for what the extents ask, the panels along that axis are drawn
 * proportionally smaller so the content keeps a minimum and nothing overflows;
 * the extents themselves are kept and come back with the room.
 *
 * Sides are physical: the layout lays itself out left-to-right whatever the
 * `LayoutDirection` in force, so [DockSide.Left] is the left edge of the
 * screen in a right-to-left app too. The direction is restored for the
 * content, the panels and the slots, which see the one the layout was
 * composed in.
 *
 * Compose it inside a window that joined the workspace, typically as the body
 * of a `WindowScaffold`. The window it is composed in ([host], resolved from
 * [LocalTaoWindow]) is what [SatelliteEntry.dockHost] refers to.
 *
 * The layout is also the drop target for satellite drags
 * ([Modifier.satelliteDragHandle]): a strip of [SatelliteWorkspace.DockZoneWidth]
 * inside each edge lights up while a dragged satellite hovers it, and a panel
 * dragged out of its dock is outlined under the pointer until released. Over
 * a side that already has panels, the pointer's place along the stack picks
 * the rank the drop takes — a bar between the two panels it would land
 * between — so the panels of a side are reordered by dragging one over the
 * others; the rank it holds is no target. A panel docked again without a
 * drag (`SatelliteScope.dock()`, [SatelliteWorkspace.dock] with no order)
 * comes back to the rank it left.
 *
 * Each panel is the satellite's `header` above its `content`, composed here
 * in the host window's scene under the satellite's own saveable-state
 * registry — see [Satellite]. A panel keeps its composition — its `remember`s
 * included — through every change of this layout: a splitter drag, a
 * reorder, a move to another side, a [SatelliteWorkspace.restore], a new
 * [sideOrder]. Only leaving the host (undocking, docking elsewhere, closing)
 * disposes it. The same holds for [content].
 *
 * @param sideOrder the four sides from the outermost in; every side exactly once.
 * @param layeredSides the sides whose panels are layers rather than a split.
 * @param splitter the drag handle drawn between a side and the content, and
 *   between two panels; [DefaultDockSplitter] is a plain bar in the window
 *   style's border colour. Apply [DockSplitterScope.dockSplitterHandle] to
 *   whatever the user is meant to grab.
 * @param panel composed around each docked panel — its header over its
 *   content, handed in as the lambda's argument — to give it a frame, a card,
 *   a padding. Must invoke the lambda it is given.
