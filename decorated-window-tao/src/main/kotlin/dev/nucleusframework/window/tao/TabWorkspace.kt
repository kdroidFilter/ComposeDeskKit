/**
 * A set of tabs spread over however many windows the user has pulled them

 *
 * Tabs are **declared** once against the workspace ([Tab]) and the workspace
 * decides which window shows each of them; [TabWindows] composes one window
 * per non-empty [TabWindowGroup]:
 *
 *  - **Moving.** [move] puts a tab in another group at a given index, [reorder]
 *    moves it within its own, [tearOff] pulls it into a group of its own at a
 *    screen rect. A group that loses its last tab is dropped, and its window
 *    goes with it; a tear-off adds one, and a window appears.
 *  - **Dragging.** [Modifier.tabDragHandle] — installed on every tab of the
 *    default strip — drives it: dragging a tab out of a multi-tab window
 *    previews it under the pointer and lands it in whichever strip it is
 *    dropped on, or in a new window; dragging the *only* tab of a window moves
 *    that window instead, exactly as Chrome does, and merges it into the strip
 *    it is dropped on.
 *  - **Selection.** [select] picks the visible tab of a group; a tab arriving
 *    from a drag is selected in its new group, and a group whose selected tab
 *    leaves selects its neighbour.
 *
 * `rememberSaveable` state inside a tab's body survives every move; plain
 * `remember` state does not, exactly as when any composable moves between
 * windows — hoist it or make it saveable.
 *
 * Every member of this class is meant for the Tao event-loop thread, which is
 * also the Compose dispatcher.
 *
 * @param defaultWindowSize the size a group's window gets when nothing else
 *   determines it: the first group, and any group restored without a size.
