 * Declares a satellite of [workspace] and hosts it wherever its placement
 * says: as a [SatelliteWindow] owned by the workspace's current owner while
 * floating, or — while docked — inside the [DockLayout] of the window it is
 * docked into. Only one host composes the [content] at a time.
 *
 * Declare it once, at application scope, next to the windows that join the
 * workspace:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val workspace = rememberSatelliteWorkspace()
 * DecoratedWindow(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication) {
 *     JoinSatelliteWorkspace(workspace)
 *     DockLayout(workspace) { Document() }
 * }
 * Satellite(workspace, id = "tools", title = "Tools") { ToolsPanel() }
 * ```
 *
 * `rememberSaveable` state inside [content] survives docking and undocking:
 * the workspace carries it from one host to the next. Plain `remember` state
 * does not, exactly as when any composable moves between windows — hoist it
 * or make it saveable.
 *
 * On native **Wayland** the dock drag rides the platform's drag-and-drop
 * session from the header strip: a reduced picture of the palette follows the
 * pointer instead of the window, and releasing it in a dock zone docks the
 * satellite (see [Modifier.satelliteDragHandle]). The palette is moved by the
 * caption strip beside its window controls, the compositor's own drag.
 * `NUCLEUS_TAO_LINUX_RENDERER=x11` restores the window-following gesture of
 * the other platforms.
 *
 * The workspace remembers the satellite ([SatelliteEntry]) after this
 * composable leaves composition, so [initialPlacement] and [initiallyOpen]
 * only apply the first time an [id] is declared (and never when a
 * [SatelliteWorkspace.restore] already placed it).
 *
 * @param id stable identity within the workspace.
 * @param title shown by the default [header] and as the floating window title.
 * @param initialPlacement where the satellite starts on first declaration.
 * @param initiallyOpen whether it is shown on first declaration.
 * @param dockSides the sides the satellite may be docked on: the others are
 *   neither offered while it is dragged nor accepted by
 *   [SatelliteWorkspace.dock]. Empty makes it a floating-only palette. Fixed
 *   on first declaration, like the placement; a docked [initialPlacement]
 *   must name one of them.
 * @param floatable whether the satellite can be a window of its own. `false`
 *   is a fixed panel: no tear-out, [SatelliteWorkspace.undock] refuses it,
 *   the default header offers no Float action, and a drag can only move it
 *   inside the dock. Requires a docked [initialPlacement].
 * @param reorderable whether the user may change its rank on its side.
 *   `false` pins it to the rank it was declared with: its own drag is offered
 *   none, and another panel can be dropped after it but never in front of it.
 *   Requires a docked [initialPlacement]. With `floatable = false` and a
 *   single [dockSides], the panel is furniture and its header is not even a
 *   drag handle.
 * @param resizable whether the floating window can be resized by the user.
 * @param hideWhileOwnerFullscreenOrMaximized hide the floating window while
 *   the owner fills the screen; see [SatelliteWindow].
 * @param compositionLocalContext parent locals bridged into the floating
 *   window's own scene, as for [SatelliteWindow]. Docked content composes
 *   inside the host window and needs no bridge.
 * @param floatingContentWrapper composed around the floating window's chrome
 *   and content, inside the window's own scene — the hook framework layers
 *   use to provide their per-window locals. Must invoke the lambda it is given.
 * @param header chrome shown in the floating window's title bar and above the
 *   docked panel; [DefaultSatelliteHeader] draws the title and dock actions.
 * @param content the satellite's body.

/**
 * Makes this element the grip that drags the satellite between its hosts.
 *
 * Dragging a floating satellite moves its window along with the pointer; a
 * docked one shows an outline following the pointer. In both cases the dock
 * zones of every window in the workspace light up as the pointer enters them
 * ([SatelliteWorkspace.dockPreview]), and releasing:
 *
 *  - in a zone docks the satellite there (or re-docks it, from another side
 *    or another window);
 *  - anywhere else, from a dock, lifts the panel out as a window under the
 *    pointer; from a floating window, just leaves it where it was dropped.
 *
 * The pointer turns into an open hand over the grip and a closed one while
 * dragging, and a press without movement does nothing, so buttons can sit
 * inside it.
 * The press is claimed, which keeps an enclosing title bar from starting the
 * native window move instead (see `Modifier.noWindowDrag`) — the window is
 * moved by the workspace so the drop can be decided from the pointer position,
 * at the cost of the OS's own snapping while a satellite is dragged.
 *
 * A floating satellite's title bar already carries this handle across its
 * whole surface, so custom chrome for one needs it only on elements *outside*
 * that bar. A docked panel's header needs it.
 *
 * On native **Wayland** the gesture rides the platform's drag-and-drop
 * session instead, since xdg-shell gives a client neither its windows' screen
 * position nor a way to place them: a reduced picture of the palette follows
 * the pointer, the dock zones of the window the pointer is over light up, and
 * releasing in one docks the satellite there. The floating window itself does
 * not follow — it stays where it is. There the handle covers the header strip
 * of the floating title bar rather than the whole bar, and the caption strip
 * beside the window controls keeps the compositor's move, so the palette can
 * still be moved. Custom floating chrome gets the same split for free: it is
 * composed inside that handle.
 *
 * No-op outside a Tao window, and on a satellite a drag could not move
 * anywhere — fixed to one side, pinned to its rank and alone in the workspace
 * — rather than leaving a gesture that can only end where it started.
