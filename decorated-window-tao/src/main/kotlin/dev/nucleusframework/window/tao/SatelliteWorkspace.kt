 *  - **Owner.** Floating satellites are owned by, anchored to and follow the

 *    closes, the previously focused member takes over and the satellites move

 *    number of document windows this way — no reparenting call needed.
 *  - **Docking.** [dock] turns a floating satellite into a panel inside the
 *    owner's [DockLayout]; [undock] lifts it back out as a window placed
 *    exactly where the panel was. `rememberSaveable` state inside the
 *    satellite survives both moves.
 *  - **Collective state.** [visible] hides and restores every satellite at
 *    once (the "Tab hides all palettes" gesture); [snapshot] / [restore]
 *    capture the whole layout for the app to persist.
 *
 * Every member of this class is meant for the Tao event-loop thread, which is
 * also the Compose dispatcher.
