 * A group appears when a tab is torn off and disappears when its last tab
 * leaves, so windows follow the tabs without the app opening or closing any.
 * The strip is the top of the window and the selected tab fills the rest;
 * [windowBodyWrapper] is where an app puts chrome of its own between the two —
 * `examples/reader-dock-demo` hangs a whole `DockLayout` of satellites there.
 * [onLastWindowClosed] fires when the final group goes, which is where an app
 * calls `exitApplication`.
 *
 * `rememberSaveable` state inside a tab survives the move from one window to
 * the next: the workspace carries it across, and the body is composed from one
 * shared call site here so the two compositions agree on its keys.
 *
 * @param strip the chrome of one window's tab strip; [TabStrip] by default.
 *   Composed inside the window's title bar.
 * @param compositionLocalContext parent locals bridged into every window's own
 *   scene, as for [DecoratedWindow].
 * @param windowContentWrapper composed around each window's chrome and
 *   content, inside that window's scene — the hook framework layers use to
 *   provide their per-window locals. Must invoke the lambda it is given.
 * @param windowBodyWrapper composed *inside* each window, below the tab strip,
 *   around the selected tab's body: where chrome that belongs to the window
 *   rather than to a tab goes — a `DockLayout` and its satellites, an activity
 *   bar, a status bar. The strip stays at the very top of the window, and the
 *   wrapper is one call site for every window, so nothing a tab change does
 *   rebuilds it. Must invoke the lambda it is given.
 * @param onLastWindowClosed called every time the workspace goes from holding
 *   groups to holding none — never for the empty workspace this composable
 *   first sees, since the tabs are declared after it.
