/**
 * The stock tab strip: one tab per entry of the group, the selected one
 * highlighted, each draggable between windows ([Modifier.tabDragHandle]) and
 * closable.
 *
 * The strip publishes its own geometry to the workspace, which is what lets a
 * tab dragged out of *another* window be dropped into this one — so custom
 * chrome should either build on this composable or publish the same geometry
 * with [Modifier.tabStripGeometry].
 *
 * Colours come from [LocalTitleBarStyle], so the strip matches whatever
 * title-bar theme the app installed.
 *
 * A tab dragged along its own strip stays in the strip's hands: it is drawn
 * under the pointer, its neighbours slide aside as its edge crosses their
 * centres, and on release it slides into the slot it was over before the
 * order changes — the motion of a browser's tab strip. Taken out of the strip
 * it becomes a ghost window, as a tab dragged to another window does, and the
 * strip it is carried over opens a slot of its width where it would land,
 * showing the same card ([dropGhost]), so the tab is seen taking its place
 * before it is let go.
 *
 * @param reorderAnimation how a tab travels along the strip — pushed aside,
 *   or sliding home; `null` moves it at once. Only the drawing is animated:
 *   the strip's published geometry is the settled layout throughout, so a
 *   drop resolved mid-motion still lands where the strip says it will.
 * @param trailing chrome placed right after the last tab — a new-tab button,
 *   typically. It sits inside the strip, so the strip stays a single drop
 *   target and a tab released over it is appended.
