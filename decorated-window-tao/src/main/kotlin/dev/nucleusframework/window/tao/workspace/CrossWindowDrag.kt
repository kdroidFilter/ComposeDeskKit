 * act on a later release.
 *

 * publishes (the dragged item, the drop preview, the ghost).

 * Once the touch slop is passed, [begin] is asked for the drag with the
 * pointer's screen position; it is then fed every move and the release, or
 * cancelled when the gesture is abandoned — including when this modifier is
 * detached or re-keyed mid-drag (a window resize does that), which no branch
 * of the gesture itself would observe.
 *
 * The press is claimed in the Main pass, which keeps an enclosing title bar
 * from starting the native window move instead (see `Modifier.noWindowDrag`).
 * The pointer shows [idleIcon] over the grip and [draggingIcon] while
 * [isDragging] holds.
 *
 * Pointer events keep arriving while the button is held, with coordinates
 * outside the window if need be: the OS captures the pointer for the pressed
 * window, which is what lets a drag leave one window and land on another.
 *
 * No-op outside a Tao window. On a window without client-side screen
 * placement ([canPlaceOnScreen] — native Wayland) the gesture is a
 * [TransferDrag] instead, asked of [beginTransfer]: the platform's DnD session
 * carries it and the window the pointer is over resolves the drop, since no
 * window can be moved or hit-tested from here. See [transferDragHandle].
