/**
 * JNI bridge to the Linux touch + touchpad-gesture helper for the Tao backend.
 *
 * Implements Stage 1 of `TOUCH_PLAN.md` on Linux: touchscreen multi-touch
 * (Wayland + X11/XWayland) and trackpad pinch/rotate (Wayland-only — see
 * `TOUCH_LINUX_RESEARCH_RESPONSE.md` and Mozilla bug 1581126 for why GTK 3
 * doesn't expose touchpad gestures on its X11 backend).
 *
 * Same shape as [NativeTaoLinuxDndBridge]: per-window install/revoke from
 * the Tao event-loop thread (= GTK main thread = Compose dispatcher
 * thread); the native side holds a `GlobalRef` on the callback object until
 * revoke is called.
 *
 * Wire format:
 *
 * - **Touch**: every event sends the *full* set of currently-down fingers
 *   so the JVM side can call `ComposeScene.sendPointerEvent(eventType,
 *   pointers = list)` directly — Compose treats absence as release. The
 *   released-this-event finger is still present in the array with its bit
 *   cleared in [Callback.onTouchEvent.pressedMask], so the JVM can emit a
 *   single `Release` carrying the final position.
 * - **Trackpad gesture**: matches [NativeTaoBridge.EventCallback.onTrackpadGesture]
 *   exactly — same kind / phase / fixed-point scaling. The Rust side has
 *   already converted GDK's absolute pinch scale into a per-event ratio
 *   (forwarded as Compose Scale events, #660) and GDK's radian angle
 *   deltas into degrees, so the JVM-side math is platform-independent.
 *
 * Coordinates passed to [Callback.onTouchEvent] are physical pixels in the
 * GtkWindow's bin-child coordinate space, encoded as fixed-point ×1024
 * — the same encoding the rest of the Tao pointer pipeline uses
 * ([events.rs::CURSOR_FIXED_SCALE]).
