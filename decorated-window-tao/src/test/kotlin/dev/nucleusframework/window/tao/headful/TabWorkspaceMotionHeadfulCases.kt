/**
 * How the tab workspace behaves under motion, on real windows: what the
 * pointer does between the grab and the drop.
 *
 *  1. **a real mouse** — driven by the AWT Robot, in
 *     [TabWorkspaceMouseHeadfulCases];
 *  2. **teleports** — samples with nothing in between, which is what a fast
 *     drag actually delivers once the OS has coalesced it, and what a synthetic
 *     replay delivers by construction;
 *  3. **the strip edge** — a pointer that crosses in and out of a strip dozens
 *     of times must leave the preview in step with the last sample, not one
 *     behind;
 *  4. **a window that moves under the gesture** — the target resized or moved
 *     mid-drag, so the strip the drop resolves against is not where it was at
 *     the grab;
 *  5. **the single-tab window drag** — the window itself follows the pointer,
 *     its own strip travels under it, and only *another* window's strip may
 *     answer the drop.
 *
 * Native Wayland is skipped along with the rest of the tab suite.
