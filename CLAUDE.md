# Nucleus

A multi-module Gradle plugin and runtime library toolkit for shipping production-ready JVM desktop applications on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Published releases are `2.5.x` (latest tag `v2.5.0`). Do not treat `IDEAL_API.md` as current — that file is gone; the real entry point is `nucleusApplication(args) { }` in `nucleus-application`. Plugin-injected strings are `NucleusApp`, not a generated `NucleusGenerated` object.

- `decorated-window-tao` - **The only window backend** — no-AWT window shell over the Rust `tao` crate via JNI (Metal on macOS, EGL on Linux, ANGLE/GLES on Windows), single native event-loop thread as `Dispatchers.Main`
- `decorated-window-tao` internals: `window/tao/workspace/` is the shared, `internal` core behind the multi-window archetypes — `WindowGroup` (membership, focus recency, pinning), `RelocatedContentHost` + `RelocatingSaveableStateRegistry` (`rememberSaveable` state that follows content between windows), `HostGeometry` (drop targets in physical screen px), `CrossWindowDrag` (one live drag, screen-space drag handle), `DragGhostWindow`, `ScreenPlacement` (the public capability is `TaoWindow.canPlaceOnScreen` — the native-Wayland gate — GDK reports every toplevel at `(0, 0)` and ignores moves, so anything that treats `outerBoundsPx()`'s origin as a screen coordinate must check it; the size half stays valid there; `warnScreenPlacementUnsupported` logs the gap once per process), `TransferDrag` (the native-Wayland path of every cross-window gesture: the grip starts a platform **drag-and-drop** session carrying an in-process token (`TaoPrivateTransfer`, `SAME_APP` only), the window under the pointer resolves the drop in its *own* coordinates and records it on the session, and the source acts on that record when the session ends — inverted roles versus `ScreenDrag`, because the source is told nothing about where the pointer is; the drag icon is a reduced snapshot of the dragged palette or panel, taken through `TaoWindow.contentSnapshot`). `SatelliteWorkspace` (docking) and `TabWorkspace` (Chrome-like tabs) are both built on it — put new cross-window gestures there rather than duplicating the geometry or the drag bookkeeping. `DockLayout` (`window/tao/DockLayout.kt` + `DockSplitter.kt` + `DockTransferTarget.kt`) is the dock: sides nest in `sideOrder` (outermost first, default `DefaultDockSideOrder` = top, bottom, left, right — **not** `DockSide.entries`, whose declaration order is left, right, top, bottom), a side is either *split* (panels share its length by `Docked.weight` and its thickness by `dockExtent(side)`) or *layered* (`layeredSides`: each panel a full-length layer of its own `Docked.extent`, the way a nested split-pane tree looks), `splitter` / `panel` slots carry the app's own chrome (`DockSplitterScope.dockSplitterHandle()` is the gesture; an overflowing `requiredWidth` grip on a 1 dp line works), sides are physical and the layout forces LTR internally then restores the caller's direction for content/panels/slots, and every panel and the content are `movableContentOf` so no layout change (extent, weight, order, side, restore, side order, direction) rebuilds a subtree — the layout's inputs live in `DockLayoutState` as snapshot state because the bands are separate composables that strong skipping would otherwise skip. Extents are fitted proportionally when the window is too small (`fit`). Drop feedback lives in `DockZoneHints.kt` and **the rectangles it draws are the target**: it publishes them to `HostGeometry.zoneBoundsInWindowPx`, and `dockTargetAt(draggedScreenRectPx, pointerScreenPx)` → `dockSideEntered` resolves a drop against those, not against the window's edges — on a layered side the strip is inset behind the existing layers, and the window's own edge behind them is nothing. A zone is entered when the dragged **satellite's** edge (its window, or the tear-out ghost) is within one zone thickness of the zone's outer edge and overlaps it across the other axis — edge alignment, not overlap, or a full-height panel could never be torn out; the pointer inside a zone is a second trigger and the tie-break, else the smallest gap wins. The rects come from `DockLayoutState.landingRectPx`: the side's measured band, inside existing layers, counting the dragged panel's own side as already freed; `hintedSides` drops the side the panel is alone on in that window, so it is neither drawn nor droppable. **`dockSides`**: `Satellite(dockSides = …)` (default all four, empty = floating-only) is fixed at declaration and enforced everywhere — `dock()` and `restore()` refuse another side, `hintedSides` and `DockZoneHints` neither draw nor publish it, the drag sessions resolve through `dockTargetFor(entry, …)` and the Wayland target filters on `drag.entry.dockSides`, and the default header hides its Dock action for a floating-only palette. **`floatable = false`** is the opposite knob — a fixed panel: `undock()` refuses it, a `restore()` that floats it is ignored, the docked drag publishes no tear-out ghost and a release off every zone leaves it in place, the default header drops its Float action, and the declaration requires a docked `initialPlacement`. **`reorderable = false`** pins the rank: `dock(order)` is ignored for it (it takes the declared rank back), `insertInStack` pushes any other panel past the last pinned one (`pinnedFloor`), `dropSlotsPx` returns nothing for a pinned dragged panel and keeps the forbidden ranks as **empty** slots so a slot's index is still its rank, `hintedSides` drops its own side, `targetFor` strips the rank off a target, and `satelliteDragHandle` is inert when `canBeDragged` says a drag could not end anywhere. **Telling the two gestures apart** (what an app adapts its UI to, #663 review): `TaoWindow.canPlaceOnScreen` is the public capability (branch on it, not on `isNativeWaylandSurface`), `SatelliteScope.isCompositorPlaced` is the same answer for the window the chrome is composed in (the floating scope reads the satellite's own window through a lambda since the scope outlives it; the docked scope reads `entry.dockHost`), `SatelliteCaptionStripWidth` + the `floatingCaption` slot of `Satellite` are the strip the title bar leaves to the compositor's move — reserved and composed **only** where `isCompositorPlaced`, so an app never has to guess a width or accidentally claim the only area that can move the palette — and `SatelliteWorkspace.dragKind` (`Window` / `Transfer`) says how a drag in flight is carried, which is what tells preview code whether `dragGhost` will ever be published. `reader-dock-demo`: the book tree and the contents are `floatable = false` + `reorderable = false` + `dockSides = setOf(Right)` — furniture, and no pane can be dropped in front of them. **Ranks**: `Docked.order` is kept contiguous from 0 per (host, side) by `dock()` / `undock()` (`dock(order)` inserts at that index, `null` = the rank the entry last held on that side, remembered in `SatelliteEntry.dockMemory`, else the end), and a side with panels publishes `DockDropZone.slots` — one rect per rank, cut at the neighbours' centres, the dragged panel excluded — so `DockTarget.order` is the rank under the pointer (`dockSlotAt`), drawn as an insertion bar (`insertionBarPx`), the own rank (`ownTarget`) being no target; a pointer over a stack beats a strip across its corner. `dropAt` converts a shown-rank into the full rank (closed panels keep theirs). The Wayland DnD path (`DockTransferTarget`) hit-tests the same published zones. A hand-driven `beginDrag` session must wait for the zones to be published before its first sample, or it resolves against the bare edges. `dock()` and the preview share one width (`dockSeedExtent`), so what lights up is what the release produces. Headful coverage: `DockLayoutHeadfulCases` (robot splitter drags) + `DockLayoutMonkeyHeadfulCases` (profiles × seeds, `-Dnucleus.tao.headful.filter="dock layout"`).
- `decorated-window-jewel` - Jewel (IntelliJ theme) integration
- `decorated-window-material2` - Material 2 color mapping
- `decorated-window-material3` - Material 3 color mapping
- `plugin-build/plugin` - Gradle plugin for packaging & distribution
- `buildSrc` - Build-only convention plugins (`nucleus.native-module`: the shared `buildNative*` wiring for every JNI module)
- `examples/` - Demo & sample applications: `nucleus-demo` (flagship), `compose-demo`, `tao-demo`, `swing-tao-demo`, `jewel-demo`, `cmp-demo` (KMP), `window-scaffold-demo`, `satellite-demo` (satellite workspace: floating palettes following the focused document, docking into a `DockLayout`, drag-to-dock, layout snapshots), `tabs-demo` (Chrome-like tabs: tear-off, merge, reorder, state following a tab between windows, layout snapshots), `jewel-tabs-demo` (the same tab workspace wearing Jewel's `TabStrip` / `TabData.Editor` chrome), `tab-satellites-demo` (the two archetypes composed: one `SatelliteWorkspace` per tab window, palettes drawing the window's selected tab), `reader-dock-demo` (a right-to-left book reader whose every pane is a satellite: layered right side with per-pane widths, `sideOrder` putting the right side outside the bottom one, the reader's own 1 dp + 5 dp-grip splitters and hover headers, Classic/Islands styles — the target layout of SeforimApp), `zstd-demo`, `scheduler-demo`, `service-management-demo`, `system-info-demo`, `fs-watcher-smoke`, `orphan-reflect-smoke`, `extra-launcher-demo`, `tao-native-test` (GraalVM + SLF4J fixture), `benchmark-demo` (JIT-vs-GraalVM-O3, ports under `ports/`), `gstreamer-demo` / `mediafoundation-demo` / `avfoundation-demo` (platform video into a `TextureView`), plus `shared` (Compose helper used by the tao demos). `native-proxy` and `spellcheck` directories on disk are **not** on `main` — ignore them unless the matching feature branch is checked out.

## Key Technologies

- Kotlin 2.4 with Compose Desktop 1.11
- JNI for all native interop (no JNA in runtime modules)
- Gradle 9.4 with version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`)
- Detekt + KtLint for code quality

## Development Notes

- Target: JDK 17+ runtime, JDK 25+ recommended for AOT
- JNI code: be careful with macOS ARC/retain and weak references
- Native modules use platform-specific JNI implementations — test on each OS
- Plugin is published via included build in `plugin-build/`
- Version catalog is the source of truth for all dependency versions
- **Compose window API v2**: Compose 1.12's `androidx.compose.ui.window.v2` types are hard-wired to AWT (`Screen` wraps a `GraphicsDevice`, `WindowGeometryProviderScope` takes a displayable `java.awt.Window`), so they are **not accepted** by any Nucleus window API — a half-working surface (scoped providers and `requestScreen` inert) is worse than none. The supported v2 surface is `dev.nucleusframework.window.tao.v2`, a member-for-member AWT-free clone backed by `TaoMonitors` + `TaoWindow`: migrating from the Compose package is a single import change, and deleting the clone restores the upstream import if JetBrains decouples its own types. Multi-monitor geometry comes from `TaoMonitors` (`EnumDisplayMonitors` / `NSScreen.screens` / GDK), never `GraphicsEnvironment`
- **No reflection**: runtime modules must stay GraalVM native-image compatible, so reflection is not an acceptable implementation tool — not even with a graceful fallback. Reach for a static bridge instead (e.g. a friend-package Java accessor like `androidx.compose.ui.draganddrop.TaoTransferableAccess`, which reads Kotlin `internal` members through their `$ui`-mangled JVM names), a public API of our own, or a plugin bytecode transform. A feature that can only be built reflectively is a feature we do not ship: document the gap and offer a working alternative
- **Public API freeze**: root `build.gradle.kts` applies kotlinx binary-compatibility-validator + `explicitApi()` to every non-example module. Baselines live in `<module>/api/<module>.api`. After intentional public API changes run `./gradlew apiDump` and commit the dump; `apiCheck` (wired into `check` / `preMerge`) fails on accidental ABI drift. Exception: `decorated-window-jewel` (JVM 25) is ignored by BCV until ASM supports class-file 69 — still uses `explicitApi()`. Helper: `scripts/fix-explicit-api.py` for mechanical visibility/return-type fixes from kotlinc diagnostics.
- **KDoc on public API**: `UndocumentedPublicClass` / `UndocumentedPublicFunction` are enforced by detekt (`detekt` is wired into `check` / `preMerge`). Pre-existing gaps are grandfathered in per-module `<module>/detekt-baseline.xml` files — any *new* undocumented public class or function fails the build. Do not regenerate a baseline to silence a new finding; write the KDoc. `UndocumentedPublicProperty` stays off because the generated icon/symbol catalogs (`sf-symbols`, `freedesktop-icons`) would swamp it
- **Logging**: `java.util.logging` is the single facade for every runtime module — no SLF4J dependency forced on consumers, no raw `println` / `System.err` in `src/main`. Logger names must be the fully-qualified class name (or an explicit `dev.nucleusframework.*` string) so the whole framework sits under one JUL namespace. `allowNucleusRuntimeLogging = true` is an opt-in convenience that raises the `dev.nucleusframework` logger to `nucleusLoggingLevel` and attaches a colored console handler; apps that configure JUL themselves (`logging.properties`, `jul-to-slf4j`) leave it `false` and Nucleus never touches the JUL configuration
- `decorated-window-tao` is the only window backend (no AWT, native event-loop-driven, true Windows fullscreen, GraalVM native-image first-class). The AWT-based backends (`decorated-window-awt` / `-jbr` / `-jni`), `NucleusBackend`, `LocalNucleusBackend`, the `backend =` parameter of `nucleusApplication`, and `NucleusWindowUnsafe.awtWindow` / `awtDialog` were all removed in 2.6. Compose Desktop's AWT `Window` / `Dialog` / `Tray` are unsupported — use `DecoratedWindow`, `HostedWindow` / `HostedDialog`, and an AWT-free tray
- **macOS trackpad on Tao** (#652–#654): scroll deltas are AWT-shaped (`preciseWheelRotation`, no display scale). Trackpad gestures reach Compose as `PanStart` / `PanMove` / `PanEnd` (`panOffset` = AWT delta × 10 dp), wheel notches as `Scroll`; foundation's `Modifier.scrollable` handles both. Custom handlers that only listen for `PointerEventType.Scroll` must also handle Pan, or the app can set `-Dnucleus.tao.trackpadPanEvents=false` to get AWT-style `Scroll` for everything. Everything scroll-related enters the scene through `TaoSceneScrollRouter` (window + NSPanel popups); the phase wire (Rust `SCROLL_GESTURE_*`, `popup_panel.m`, `TaoScrollGesturePhase`) is guarded by `TaoScrollWireDriftTest`
- macOS Liquid Glass enabled by default via `macOsSdkVersion = "26.0"` (vtool SDK patching)
- The HotSpot GC is selected type-safely with `application { garbageCollector = GarbageCollector.Z }` (unset = JVM ergonomics). The flags are prepended to the launcher `.cfg` java-options and to the `run` task — before `jvmArgs`, so an explicit `-XX:+Use…GC` there still wins — and the AOT training run inherits them from the `.cfg`

## Adding a Native JNI Module

When creating a new module with platform-specific JNI libraries, all steps below are required:

1. **Native source** — `<module>/src/main/native/{linux,macos,windows}/` with `build.sh`/`build.bat` + C/ObjC source. Library name: `nucleus_<feature>`. Linux: prefer `dlopen` over hard compile-time deps. Rust modules keep the crate at `src/main/native/` (`Cargo.toml` + `src/`) and only the launcher script under the per-OS directory.
2. **Build output** — scripts must place binaries in `<module>/src/main/resources/nucleus/native/{linux-x64,linux-aarch64,darwin-x64,darwin-aarch64,win32-x64,win32-aarch64}/`.
3. **Gradle wiring** — apply `id("nucleus.native-module")` and declare one line per platform. That is the whole build-script surface: the convention plugin (`buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/dev/nucleusframework/gradle/NativeModulePlugin.kt`) registers `buildNative{Windows,MacOs,Linux}` with the source inputs, the resources output, the host-OS and prebuilt-on-CI guards, the absolute build-script path, the `NativeLibraryLoader` cache eviction, and the `processResources` / `sourcesJar` dependencies.
   ```kotlin
   nucleusNative {
       macos("nucleus_feature")    // → libnucleus_feature.dylib
       linux("nucleus_feature")    // → libnucleus_feature.so
       windows("nucleus_feature")  // → nucleus_feature.dll
   }
   ```
4. **Kotlin JNI bridge** — `internal object` using `NativeLibraryLoader.load()` with `@JvmStatic external` methods. Always provide a Kotlin fallback when native lib is unavailable.
5. **GraalVM reachability metadata** — create `<module>/src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/dev.nucleusframework/nucleus.<module>/reachability-metadata.json` declaring all JNI-accessible classes/methods. Without this, native-image silently eliminates the bridge.
6. **CI build** (`build-natives.yaml`) — add one build step per platform job, gated with `if: steps.natives-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'`, plus the library entries in that platform's `Verify ... natives` FILES list. Native outputs are cached keyed on `hashFiles('**/src/main/native/**', ...)`, so the new sources invalidate the cache automatically. Each platform job publishes a single merged artifact (`natives-windows`, `natives-macos`, `natives-linux-{x64,aarch64}`); consumer workflows fetch them all with one `pattern: 'natives-*'` download step and need **no changes** for a new module.
7. **CI verify lists** — add the 6 arch paths to the EXPECTED arrays of the "Verify all natives present" steps in `pre-merge.yaml` and `publish-maven.yaml`.

Common pitfalls: forgetting Linux `.so` in verify lists, missing `reachability-metadata.json`, forgetting the `cache-hit` guard on new build steps in `build-natives.yaml`.

Existing `build.sh`/`build.bat` scripts also clear the `NativeLibraryLoader` cache themselves so a bare `./build.sh` (outside Gradle) is safe; new scripts don't have to, since `nucleus.native-module` does it after every run.

## Publishing to Maven Local

Version is resolved from `GITHUB_REF` in every `build.gradle.kts` (`refs/tags/v2.4.4` → `2.4.4`). Without it, defaults to `1.0.0`.

**Prerequisites:**
- Use JDK 21 (`JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.21.0-openjdk-amd64`) — Kotlin DSL script compiler crashes on JDK 25
- Use `--no-configuration-cache` — configuration cache can serve a stale cached version
- Use absolute `-p` paths to avoid working-directory confusion
- No signing needed for local publish (signing is conditional on `signingInMemoryKey` property)

**Runtime libraries (main project):**
```bash
GITHUB_REF=refs/tags/v2.4.4 JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.21.0-openjdk-amd64 \
  ./gradlew -p /absolute/path/to/Nucleus publishToMavenLocal --no-configuration-cache
```

**Plugin (plugin-build):**
```bash
GITHUB_REF=refs/tags/v2.4.4 JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.21.0-openjdk-amd64 \
  ./gradlew -p /absolute/path/to/Nucleus/plugin-build :plugin:publishToMavenLocal --no-configuration-cache
```

Published tags are `v2.4.x`. The `v` prefix is stripped for the Maven version.

## GraalVM Native Image

- Reflection metadata is centralized in 3 levels — users no longer copy hundreds of entries:
    - **L1**: Generic cross-platform metadata shipped in `graalvm-runtime` JAR (`reachability-metadata.json` with ~300+ types)
    - **L2**: Oracle GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository — auto-resolved for classpath deps (enabled by default, `metadataRepository {}` DSL)
    - **L3**: Platform-specific metadata (macOS/Windows/Linux) shipped inside the plugin JAR under `nucleus/graalvm/platform-metadata/`
- `graalvm-runtime` auto-includes `.svg`, `.ttf`, `.otf`, `composeResources/*`, `nucleus/native/*`, and `META-INF/services/*` via `reachability-metadata.json` resource globs (the deprecated `-H:IncludeResources` option was dropped). The blanket `**/*.{svg,ttf,otf}` globs are a required catch-all for fonts/icons bundled inside **library** JARs (e.g. Jewel SVG icons) — those are not the app's own resources so `autoIncludeResources` doesn't cover them. They knowingly trigger native-image's advisory "pattern too generic" warning; do not remove them (it breaks Jewel icons in native image)
- The tracing agent (`runWithNativeAgent`) is only needed for app-specific reflection, uncommon libraries, and resource bundles
- PGO (Oracle GraalVM): `runWithPgoInstrument` builds + runs an instrumented image and records `graalvm/pgo/default.iprof` on exit; later native-image builds apply the profile automatically. Opt out with `-Pnucleus.graalvm.pgo=off`; customize via `graalvm { pgo { enabled / profile } }`
- Agent output is automatically deduplicated against library metadata on the classpath
- Sample apps have near-empty `reachability-metadata.json` — only app-specific entries remain
- `nucleusApplication` calls `GraalVmInitializer.initialize()` first. If you write a `main` that does not go through `nucleusApplication`, call `GraalVmInitializer.initialize()` yourself before anything else (required for native-image). Do not tell users to sequence GraalVM / single-instance / autolaunch / AUMID by hand — that bootstrap is already inside `nucleusApplication`. `Dispatchers.Main` on Tao is installed via `TaoMainDispatcherFactory` (ServiceLoader), not a manual `setMain`.
- Font substitutions (`@TargetClass`) in `graalvm-runtime` fix `InternalError: platform encoding not initialized` on Windows/Linux
- SLF4J is **not** initialized at build time — the API and the app-selected backend both initialize at run time, so the app keeps control of its provider, levels and environment-dependent config. Forcing `--initialize-at-build-time=org.slf4j` from a shared module breaks any run-time-initialized backend (SLF4J 2.x provider discovery parks Logback's `LogbackMDCAdapter`/`LoggerContext` in the image heap → build failure; adding backend classes one by one only exposes the next object). Apps with a fixed backend can opt in via `graalvm { buildArgs.add("--initialize-at-build-time=org.slf4j") }` — it trades a frozen provider and build-machine-captured config for a cheaper first log call. `examples/tao-native-test` bundles Logback + an `MDC` round-trip as the regression fixture
- GraalVM task surface mirrors the JVM one: `runGraalvmNative` is the fast dev loop (forces quick-build `-Ob`, ignoring the configured `optimization`), while `createGraalvmNativeDistributable` / `runGraalvmNativeDistributable` / `packageGraalvmNativeDistributionForCurrentOS` build & run the full app folder with the configured optimization (mirror `createDistributable` / `runDistributable` / `packageDistributionForCurrentOS`). Quick vs distributable is detected from the invoked task name and tracked as a compile input, so switching re-compiles
- Native images bake a default max heap of 25% of RAM (`-R:MaximumHeapSizePercent=25`, JVM/HotSpot parity) instead of native-image's Serial-GC default of 80%; configurable via `graalvm { maxHeapSizePercent = N }` or an absolute `graalvm { maxHeapSize = "2g" }`, and always overridable at runtime with `-Xmx`
- The image's GC is baked at build time via `graalvm { garbageCollector = NativeImageGarbageCollector.G1 }` (`--gc=`, unset = native-image's Serial GC). `G1` is Oracle GraalVM + Linux only and degrades to a warning plus the Serial GC anywhere else; the baked heap percentage follows the collector (`-R:MaximumHeapSizePercent` for Serial/Epsilon, `-R:MaxRAMPercentage` for G1, which does not know the former)
- The GraalVM toolchain is auto-downloaded by default (`graalvm { toolchain { } }` DSL), but only when `graalvm { isEnabled = true }` and only when a native-image task actually runs — every provider is resolved in `doFirst`, so an IDE sync or `gradlew tasks` never pulls a JDK. Cached under `~/.gradle/nucleus/graalvm/`.
- **Distribution defaults to GraalVM Community Edition** (`toolchain { distribution }`, GPLv2+CE, resolved from the `graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds` GitHub releases). `GraalvmDistribution.ORACLE` opts into Oracle GraalVM and logs a GFTC licensing warning — the GFTC forbids charging any fee associated with redistributing the Program, and the plugin ships GraalVM runtime libs (`libjvm`, `libawt`, …) next to the executable. In community mode the Oracle-only `runWithPgoInstrument` task is **not registered at all**; `-O3`, `--pgo` and `-H:AdvancedObfuscation` degrade to a warning. `examples/benchmark-demo` opts into ORACLE because `-O3`/PGO are its whole point.
- Install dirs embed the distribution (`graalvm-community-jdk-*` vs `graalvm-jdk-*`), so a pre-existing Oracle download is never silently reused after the default flipped; a `GRAALVM_HOME` whose distribution disagrees with the DSL is ignored with a warning. The CI cache key includes the distribution too.
- Channel/version: innovation by default (`25i3` / GraalVM 25.3.4.1), `channel = GraalvmChannel.LTS` or an explicit `version` ("25", "25.0.1"). On Intel macs (dropped by both distributions after 25.0.1) it falls back to Liberica NIK via the BellSoft API — only the JDK feature version carries over there (BellSoft ships the LTS line only, so Intel macs get NIK 25.0.x even on the innovation channel). `toolchain { autoDownload = false }` restores Gradle toolchain resolution via `javaLanguageVersion`/`jvmVendor`.
