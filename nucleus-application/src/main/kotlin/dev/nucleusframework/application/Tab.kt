/**
 * One window per group of [workspace] — the Chrome tab model: a tab strip in
 * every window's title bar, the group's selected tab as its content, and
 * windows that follow the tabs instead of the app opening and closing them.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * nucleusApplication(args) {
 *     val workspace = rememberTabWorkspace()
 *     TabWindows(workspace, onLastWindowClosed = ::exitApplication)
 *     for (document in documents) {
 *         Tab(workspace, id = document.id, title = document.name) { Editor(document) }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * See [dev.nucleusframework.window.tao.TabWindows] for the full contract:
 * a tear-off opens a window and the last tab out closes one, a tab dragged
 * onto another window's strip is inserted where it is dropped, and
 * `rememberSaveable` state inside a tab survives every move.
 * `rememberTabWorkspace`, `TabStrip` and `Modifier.tabDragHandle` are used
 * as-is from `decorated-window-tao`.
 *
 * @param strip the chrome of one window's tab strip; [TabStrip] by default.
 *   Composed inside that window's title bar.
 * @param nativeContextMenu whether text fields in the tab windows get the
 *   native context menu, as for [DecoratedWindow].
 * @param windowWrapper composed around each window's chrome and content, with
 *   that window's scope as receiver — where per-window chrome goes, since the
 *   app does not open these windows itself: `WindowBackground`,
 *   `WindowAppearance`, a themed `Surface`. Must invoke the lambda it is given.
 * @param windowBodyWrapper composed inside each window, below the tab strip,
 *   around the selected tab's body: chrome that belongs to the window rather
 *   than to a tab goes here — a `DockLayout` with its satellites, an activity
 *   bar. [windowWrapper] wraps the window including its strip; this one wraps
 *   only what is under it. Must invoke the lambda it is given.
 * @param onLastWindowClosed called every time the workspace goes from holding
 *   tabs to holding none, which is where an app calls `exitApplication`.
